                <p>Whether your looking for your parts to be individually sanded/finished or your 
                  commissioning a one-off custom piece of furniture, we’ve got you covered. 
                  Our parts are finished to an accurate quality control standard and can be delivered 
                  to your chosen destination ready to go.</p>

                <h5>LASER CUTTING</h5>
                <p>We can also offer a small laser cutting/engraving service. Our maximum part size is limited 
                  to 290mm x 200mm and is able to cut up to 3mm thickness in acrylics, sheet timber and MDF. 
                  Our laser cutting service is most commonly used for burning/engraving branded content onto parts 
                  as well as cutting handy jigs and spacer offsets using acrylic. Many of our clients say using 
                  custom cut spacers and jigs, particularly when fitting units/drawers/components/fittings, saves them 
                  hours of hassle on jobs and on personal projects.

                <p>You can start off your CNC project with nothing but a simple sketch. 
                  Our in-house technicians are experienced and efficient in drawing and converting 
                  your ideas into vector format. We can then convert your drawings into G-Code 
                </p>
                <p>
                  For many projects we generate 3D models 
                  to help visualise a finished product. Our 3D modelling is also offered as a separate 
                  service if your particularly interested in having a professional 3D drawings demonstrating 
                  dimensions and axis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can also make any necessary adjustments to readily available

                <h5>2D and 3D ROUTING</h5>
                <p>We can precisely cut all manner of shapes from materials to a tolerance of + - 0.15mm. 
                  We use a range of carbide cutting bits to achieve fine crisp cut’s with maximum repeatability.

                    as 30mm x 30mm. We can use carbide cutters as small as 2mm allowing a 1mm rad for all internal corners.
                </p>
                <p>We specialise in 2D routing timber and many other hardwoods cutting and creating kitchen cupboard fronts to 
                  small batch items. We are also able to nest your parts in the most efficient way available to 
                  our bed size in order to maximise the usage of material and keep the costs down.
                </p>
                <p>We can also 3D carve designs and text directly onto your parts/projects using finely tipped 
                  90degree cutters up to a depth of 35mm</p>
